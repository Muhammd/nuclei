## File Requests

Nuclei allows modelling templates that can match/extract on filesystem too.

```yaml
# Start of file template block
file:
```

### Extensions

To match on all extensions (except the ones in default denylist), use the following - 

```yaml
extensions:
  - all
```

You can also provide a list of custom extensions that should be matched upon.

```yaml
extensions:
  - py
  - go
```

A denylist of extensions can also be provided. Files with these extensions will not be processed by nuclei.

```yaml
extensions:
  - all

denylist:
  - go
  - py
  - txt
```

By default, certain extensions are excluded in nuclei file module. A list of these is provided below- 

```
3g2,3gp,7z,apk,arj,avi,axd,bmp,css,csv,deb,dll,doc,drv,eot,exe,flv,gif,gifv,gz,h264,ico,iso,jar,jpeg,jpg,lock,m4a,m4v,map,mkv,mov,mp3,mp4,mpeg,mpg,msi,ogg,ogm,ogv,otf,pdf,pkg,png,ppt,psd,rar,rm,rpm,svg,swf,sys,tar,tar.gz,tif,tiff,ttf,txt,vob,wav,webm,wmv,woff,woff2,xcf,xls,xlsx,zip
```

### More Options

**max-size** parameter can be provided which limits the maximum size (in bytes) of files read by nuclei engine.

As default the `max-size` value is 5 MB (5242880), Files larger than the `max-size` will not be processed.

-----

**no-recursive** option disables recursive walking of directories / globs while input is being processed for file module of nuclei.

### Matchers / Extractor

**File** protocol supports 2 types of Matchers -

| Matcher Type | Part Matched |
|--------------|--------------|
| word         | all          |

  name: Google API Key

        regex:
          - "AIza[0-9A-Za-z\\-_]{35}"
```

```bash
# Running file template on http-response/ directory
nuclei -t file.yaml -target http-response/

# Running file template on output.txt
nuclei -t file.yaml -target output.txt
```
