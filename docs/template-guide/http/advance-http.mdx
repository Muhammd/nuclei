## Advance requests

We’ve enriched nuclei to allow advanced scanning of web servers. Users can now use multiple options to tune HTTP request workflows.

### Pipelining

HTTP Pipelining support has been added which allows multiple HTTP requests to be sent on the same connection inspired from [http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn](https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn).

Before running HTTP pipelining based templates, make sure the running target supports HTTP Pipeline connection, otherwise nuclei engine fallbacks to standard HTTP request engine. 

If you want to confirm the given domain or list of subdomains supports HTTP Pipelining, [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/) has a flag `-pipeline` to do so.

An example configuring showing pipelining attributes of nuclei.

```yaml
    unsafe: true
    pipeline: true
    pipeline-concurrent-connections: 40
    pipeline-requests-per-connection: 25000
```

An example template demonstrating pipelining capabilities of nuclei has been provided below-

```yaml
id: pipeline-testing
info:
  name: pipeline testing
  author: pdteam
  severity: info

http:
  - raw:
      - |+
        GET /{{path}} HTTP/1.1
        Host: {{Hostname}}
        Referer: {{BaseURL}}

    attack: batteringram
    payloads:
      path: path_wordlist.txt

    unsafe: true
    pipeline: true
    pipeline-concurrent-connections: 40
    pipeline-requests-per-connection: 25000

    matchers:
      - type: status
        part: header
        status:
          - 200
```

### Connection pooling

While the earlier versions of nuclei did not do connection pooling, users can now configure templates to either use HTTP connection pooling or not. This allows for faster scanning based on requirement.

To enable connection pooling in the template, `threads` attribute can be defined with respective number of threads you wanted to use in the payloads sections.

`Connection: Close` header can not be used in HTTP connection pooling template, otherwise engine will fail and fallback to standard HTTP requests with pooling.

An example template using HTTP connection pooling-

```yaml
id: fuzzing-example
info:
  name: Connection pooling example
  author: pdteam
  severity: info

http:

  - raw:
      - |
        GET /protected HTTP/1.1
        Host: {{Hostname}}
        Authorization: Basic {{base64('admin:§password§')}}

    attack: batteringram
    payloads:
      password: password.txt
    threads: 40

    matchers-condition: and
    matchers:
      - type: status
        status:
          - 200

      - type: word
        words:
          - "Unique string"
        part: body
```

### Smuggling

HTTP Smuggling is a class of Web-Attacks recently made popular by [Portswigger’s Research](https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn) into the topic. For an in-depth overview, please visit the article linked above.

In the open source space, detecting http smuggling is difficult particularly due to the requests for detection being malformed by nature. Nuclei is able to reliably detect HTTP Smuggling vulnerabilities utilising the [rawhttp](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/rawhttp) engine.

The most basic example of an HTTP Smuggling vulnerability is CL.TE Smuggling. An example template to detect a CE.TL HTTP Smuggling vulnerability is provided below using the `unsafe: true` attribute for rawhttp based requests.

```yaml
id: CL-TE-http-smuggling

info:
  name: HTTP request smuggling, basic CL.TE vulnerability
  author: pdteam
  severity: info
  reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/lab-basic-cl-te

http:
  - raw:
    - |+
      POST / HTTP/1.1
      Host: {{Hostname}}
      Connection: keep-alive
      Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
      Content-Length: 6
      Transfer-Encoding: chunked
      
      0
      
      G      
    - |+
      POST / HTTP/1.1
      Host: {{Hostname}}
      Connection: keep-alive
      Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
      Content-Length: 6
      Transfer-Encoding: chunked
      
      0
      
      G
            
    unsafe: true
    matchers:
      - type: word
        words:
          - 'Unrecognized method GPOST'
```

More examples are available in [template-example](/template-example/http/http-smuggling/) section for smuggling templates.

### Race conditions

Race Conditions are another class of bugs not easily automated via traditional tooling. Burp Suite introduced a Gate mechanism to Turbo Intruder where all the bytes for all the requests are sent expect the last one at once which is only sent together for all requests synchronizing the send event.

We have implemented **Gate** mechanism in nuclei engine and allow them run via templates which makes the testing for this specific bug class simple and portable.

To enable race condition check within template, `race` attribute can be set to `true` and `race_count` defines the number of simultaneous request you want to initiate.

Below is an example template where the same request is repeated for 10 times using the gate logic.

```yaml
id: race-condition-testing

info:
  name: Race condition testing
  author: pdteam
  severity: info

http:
  - raw:
      - |
        POST /coupons HTTP/1.1
        Host: {{Hostname}}

        promo_code=20OFF        

    race: true
    race_count: 10

    matchers:
      - type: status
        part: header
        status:
          - 200
```

You can simply replace the `POST` request with any suspected vulnerable request and change the `race_count` as per your need, and it's ready to run.

```bash
nuclei -t race.yaml -target https://api.target.com
```

**Multi request race condition testing**

For the scenario when multiple requests needs to be sent in order to exploit the race condition, we can make use of threads.

```yaml
    threads: 5
    race: true
```

`threads` is a total number of request you wanted make with the template to perform race condition testing.


Below is an example template where multiple (5) unique request will be sent at the same time using the gate logic.

```yaml
id: multi-request-race

info:
  name: Race condition testing with multiple requests
  author: pd-team
  severity: info

http:
  - raw:  
      - |
        POST / HTTP/1.1

        Host: {{Hostname}}
        Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform
        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0

        id=1
        
      - |
        POST / HTTP/1.1

        Host: {{Hostname}}
        Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform

      - |
        POST / HTTP/1.1
        Pragma: no-cache
        Host: {{Hostname}}
        Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform
        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0

        id=4

      - |
        POST / HTTP/1.1

        id=5

    threads: 5
    race: true
```

## Requests Annotation

Request inline annotations allow performing per request properties/behavior override. They are very similar to python/java class annotations and must be put on the request just before the RFC line. Currently, only the following overrides are supported:

- `@Host:` which overrides the real target of the request (usually the host/ip provided as input). It supports syntax with ip/domain, port, and scheme, for example: `domain.tld`, `domain.tld:port`, `http://domain.tld:port`
- `@tls-sni:` which overrides the SNI Name of the TLS request (usually the hostname provided as input). It supports any literals. The special value `request.host` uses the `Host` header and `interactsh-url` uses an interactsh generated URL.
- `@timeout:` which overrides the timeout for the request to a custom duration. It supports durations formatted as string. If no duration is specified, the default Timeout flag value is used.

The following example shows the annotations within a request:

```yaml
- |
  @Host: https://projectdiscovery.io:443
  POST / HTTP/1.1
  Pragma: no-cache
  Host: {{Hostname}}
  Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform
  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0
```
This is particularly useful, for example, in the case of templates with multiple requests, where one request after the initial one needs to be performed to a specific host (for example, to check an API validity):

```yaml
http:
  - raw:
      # this request will be sent to {{Hostname}} to get the token
      - |
        GET /getkey HTTP/1.1
        Host: {{Hostname}}
        
      # This request will be sent instead to https://api.target.com:443 to verify the token validity
      - |
        @Host: https://api.target.com:443
        GET /api/key={{token}} HTTP/1.1
        Host: api.target.com:443

    extractors:
      - type: regex
        name: token
        part: body
        regex:
          # random extractor of strings between prefix and suffix
          - 'prefix(.*)suffix'

    matchers:
      - type: word
        part: body
        words:
          - valid token
```

Example of a custom `timeout` annotations - 

```yaml
- |
  @timeout: 25s
  POST /conf_mail.php HTTP/1.1
  Host: {{Hostname}}
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  
  mail_address=%3B{{cmd}}%3B&button=%83%81%81%5B%83%8B%91%97%90M
```

Example of `sni` annotation with `interactsh-url` - 

```yaml
- |
  @tls-sni: interactsh-url
  POST /conf_mail.php HTTP/1.1
  Host: {{Hostname}}
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  
  mail_address=%3B{{cmd}}%3B&button=%83%81%81%5B%83%8B%91%97%90M
```
