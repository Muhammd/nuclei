### **Q: Who owns the templates generated by the AI?**
**A:** You own any templates generated by the AI through the Nuclei Templates Editor. They are your property, and you are granted a perpetual license to use and modify them as you see fit.

### **Q: How accurate are the templates generated by the AI?**
**A:** The accuracy of the generated templates is primarily dependent on the detail and specificity of the input you provide. The more detailed information you supply, the better the AI can understand the context and create an accurate template. However, as with any AI tool, it is highly recommended to review, validate, and test any generated templates before using them in a live environment.

### **Q: Does AI learn from the templates I generate?**
**A:** No, AI does not use the templates you generate for further training or improvement of the AI model. The system only utilizes public templates and CVE data for training, ensuring your unique templates remain confidential.
